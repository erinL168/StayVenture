## Project Description

An innovative web application that redefines the way people find and offer places to stay overnight. Users can seamlessly connect with hosts and travelers from around the world, whether you're looking to book a unique stay or earn extra income by hosting guests. 

## Development

The application is structured with a Next.js front-end and an Express.js back-end, employing MongoDB as the database. On the front-end, Next.js, a React-based framework, streamlines development with features like server-side rendering. JavaScript is used for scripting, and React facilitates the creation of modular UI components. For the back-end, Express.js, a minimal Node.js web framework, handles server-side operations, while Mongoose provides a schema-based solution for MongoDB interactions. CORS is implemented to manage cross-origin resource sharing securely. This application utilized geocoding api from Google Cloud and leaflet.js to create the map components, as well passport.js for creating a secure web application. For backend development, we used Postman to check on responses.

## Deployment

Frontend is deployed on Vercel. The backend is deployed through a docker container on a Google Cloud VM with a self-signed certificate.
